# 100DaysOfCode
Finally committing to #100DaysofCode so here are all of the projects I created during that time!
This file contains summaries of all of the days, short journal entries about the projects and my time creating them.

Day 1 - Time Clock (PHP/2hrs)
I took an old project I had made, a simple time clock that already contained variable values within the code, and updated it to take user input for the variable values. I added error checking with while statements that make sure the input is numerical, and the ability to calculate overtime. All calculations exclude taxes. That could be a project for another time. The reason it took two hours is because I went to run it in Command Prompt and realized I had never added a PHP environment. All in all it was a good step into tackling my imposters syndrome with putting my work out there!
